           <h2>About Me</h2>
           <img id="family" src="assets/images/family.jpg">

            <p>For starters I have a background in culinary and it was a passion of mine for many years.
               I enjoyed the fierce flames of the saute to the blistering heat of the broiler.
               After many years and many long hpurs of being a Chef, I decided that
               in order to start a Family I needed a change of pace for my career, one
               that would allow me to be involved with my Family on weekends, Holidays and Birthdays.
               that is why I chose to switch gears and focus on programming and web development.
               This niche of work is growing expponentially and it is time for me to hop on the tech train
               so that I can support my Family and be there for all the milestones to come.
